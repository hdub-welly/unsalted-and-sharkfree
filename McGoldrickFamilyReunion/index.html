					<p>The next McGoldrick Family Reunion will take place August 2027, in Bayfield, Wisconsin. We are looking forward to sharing with all of you, and experiencing ourselves, all that this part of the Great Lakes region has to offer. Bayfield is a humble little place (at around 600 people, it is Wisconsin's smallest incorporated city), but its location and small-town charm make it well worth spending a weekend there, even without the allure of a full-on McGoldrick family reunion to bring you.</p>
	<p>It is also important to note that the area we will be enjoying is part of the ancestral homeland of the Ojibwe people. There are two nearby reservations (one of which is home to the nation's first tribal national park), and as hosts we will strive to show a deep respect for all that the land has to offer, and to show you how special it is.</p>
